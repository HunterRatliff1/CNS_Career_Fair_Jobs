# CNS_Career_Fair_Jobs

# Source
This data is pulled from a listing of employers in attendance of the College of
Natural Sciences 
[Fall 2015 Career Fair](https://cns.utexas.edu/images/CNS/F15_Tech_And_Sci_Registration.pdf)
at the University of Texas at Austin. I've saved the data as a publicly accessible 
[Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h0hJecODfuANmDvlGavfxb0ovWiuZporNAkR2jJZAeU/pub)
which may be imported directly into R (as shown in the `.Rmd` file). Likewise, I've 
included a copy as a `.csv` file under the 
[/Sources/](https://github.com/HunterRatliff1/CNS_Career_Fair_Jobs/blob/master/Sources/F15_CNS-career_fair.csv)
subdirectory.

# Results
The figures generated by the 
[CNS-Career-Fair_ProspectiveMajors.Rmd](https://github.com/HunterRatliff1/CNS_Career_Fair_Jobs/blob/master/CNS-Career-Fair_ProspectiveMajors.Rmd)
file are available under the 
[/Figures/](https://github.com/HunterRatliff1/CNS_Career_Fair_Jobs/tree/master/Figures)
subdirectory, or as a full HTML file

# TL;DR
It's a good time to be a computer science major, and it doesn't hurt to be good at math either!
