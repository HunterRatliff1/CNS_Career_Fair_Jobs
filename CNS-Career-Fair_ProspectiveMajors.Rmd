# Prepare data
First, we'll list the required packages. For space, I used `sapply` instead of the traditional `require("package.name")`. 

```{r global_options, include=FALSE}
require(knitr)

## Sets output for figures
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width=12, fig.height=8, fig.path='Figures/',
                      echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center')
```

These are the required packages:   
```{r LOAD | Packs}
sapply(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "reshape2", "magrittr", "stringi", 
         "tidyr", "reshape2", "ggthemes", "RCurl"), require, character.only=TRUE) 


source("~/Github/Citations/Citation Function.R")
```

## Load data   
   
Next, we'll read in the data from [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h0hJecODfuANmDvlGavfxb0ovWiuZporNAkR2jJZAeU/pub). I pulled this data from a PDF file on [The College Of Natural Sciences website](https://cns.utexas.edu/images/CNS/F15_Tech_And_Sci_Registration.pdf), and did a few basic transformations in Google Sheets.

```{r LOAD | data}
## Read the Google Sheet data as a CSV
url <- getURL(paste0("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/",
               "1h0hJecODfuANmDvlGavfxb0ovWiuZporNAkR2jJZAeU",
               "/pub?output=csv"))
fair <- read.csv(textConnection(url))
```

```{r BUILD | data frame}
# Melted version
df <- melt(fair, id.vars = 3, measure.vars = c(6:16))
df <- filter(df, !is.na(value), value != "NA")
df <- rename(df, Major=variable)

# Make a pretty data frame
Fair <- fair[1:nrow(fair), 2:4]

# Add the two opening types 
Fair$FullTime <- grepl(pattern = "FT",     fair$Position.Types)
Fair$Intern   <- grepl(pattern = "Intern", fair$Position.Types)

# Add degrees desired
Fair$Certificate <- grepl("Cert", fair$Degrees.Sought)
Fair$BS          <- grepl("BS", fair$Degrees.Sought)
Fair$BA          <- grepl("BA", fair$Degrees.Sought)
Fair$MS          <- grepl("MS", fair$Degrees.Sought)
Fair$Ph.D        <- grepl("Ph.D", fair$Degrees.Sought)

# Join with table that has the CSV column expanded
Fair <- left_join(Fair, df)

# Make categories
Fair$value[Fair$value=="CS"]    <- "CS"

Fair$value[Fair$value=="Stats"] <- "Maths"
Fair$value[Fair$value=="Math"]  <- "Maths"

Fair$value[Fair$value=="Chem"]     <- "NatSci"
Fair$value[Fair$value=="Bio"]      <- "NatSci"
Fair$value[Fair$value=="Biochem"]  <- "NatSci"
Fair$value[Fair$value=="Physics"]  <- "NatSci"
  
Fair$value[Fair$value=="EnviroSci"]      <- "OtherSci"
Fair$value[Fair$value=="Astronomy"]      <- "OtherSci"
Fair$value[Fair$value=="HDFS"]           <- "OtherSci"
Fair$value[Fair$value=="Public Health"]  <- "OtherSci"

# Rename to make new category
Fair <- rename(Fair, Catergory=value)
Fair$Catergory[grepl("Math", Fair$Catergory)] <- "Maths"
```

## Plots

With the data frame loaded, we can take a look at some of the high level statitisics

### Plot #1

```{r Jobs_By_Major01}
ggplot(Fair) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x=Catergory, fill=Major)) +
  coord_flip() + theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Spectral") +
  # guides(color=F) +
  labs(x="Majors", y="Number of Organizations",
       title="Career Fair - College of Natural Science,\nProspective Jobs by Major (2015)") 
citation()
```

Clearly not a bad time to be doing Computer Science or Math! Also shows how much we value Public Health :(

<br><br><hr>

### Plot #2

```{r Jobs_By_Major02}
ggplot(data = Fair) + 
  geom_jitter(aes(x=abbreviate(Organization.Name), y=Major, color=Catergory))  + 
  theme_fivethirtyeight() + coord_flip() +
  labs(x="Majors", y="Number of Organizations",
       title="Career Fair - College of Natural Science,\nProspective Jobs by Major (2015)") 
citation()
```

<br><br><hr>

### Plot #3

```{r Jobs_By_Major03}
melt(Fair, id.vars = c("Major", "Catergory"), measure.vars = c(6:10),
     variable.name = "Degree") %>% filter(value) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Major, y=Degree)) + 
  geom_jitter(aes(color=Catergory)) +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  labs(x="Majors", y="Number of Organizations",
       title="Career Fair - College of Natural Science,\nProspective Jobs by Major (2015)") 
citation()
```

<br><br><hr>

### Plot #4

```{r BUILD | Table01}
Fair[Fair==TRUE] <- 1
Table01 <- Fair %>%
  melt(id.vars = c("Major", "Catergory"), measure.vars = c(6:10),
     variable.name = "Degree") %>% 
  group_by(Degree, Major) %>% filter(value>0) %>%
  summarise(Openings = n()) %>%
  ungroup() 
```

```{r Jobs_By_Major04}
ggplot(Table01, aes(Degree, Major)) + 
  geom_tile(aes(fill=Openings)) + 
  theme_fivethirtyeight() + coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = rainbow(7)) + 
  labs(x="Degree", y="Majors",
       title="Career Fair - College of Natural Science,\nProspective Jobs by Major (2015)") 
citation()
```

```{r Table1, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(dcast(Table01, 
                   formula = Degree ~ Major, 
                   fun.aggregate = sum))
```

As a future note to self, I'd love to tie this data in with data from LinkedIn via [the LinkedIn API](https://developer-programs.linkedin.com/documents/job-search-api). [This guide](http://thinktostart.com/analyze-linkedin-with-r/) looks promising and should work well with the `tm` package.
